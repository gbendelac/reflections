When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   when you want to share with or demo your project to someone else, or colaborate with a team.
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   because you might have to make many or mutiple commits before you want to share the code with someone else.
   
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   Forks are like clones but strictly on GitHub, so they create a new repository on GitHub while maintaining a historic link to the original
   GitHub repository, but without impacting the original repository. Clones can duplicate git repositories either locally or from GitHub to
   a local client PC. Branches are multiple instances/chains of commits within a single git repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

   you can take a break or be off line for a while and then once you restart working you can fetch the latest changes from the remote repository
   and see all the differences while you were away.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?   
   without Git or GitHub collaboration would have to be done orally or by emails and code reviews. It is easier to collaborate with GitHub.
