When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   when you want to share with or demo your project to someone else, or colaborate with a team.
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   because you might have to make many or mutiple commits before you want to share the code with someone else.
